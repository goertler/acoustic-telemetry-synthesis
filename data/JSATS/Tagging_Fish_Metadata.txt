No tag or other definitive sign of an implant was observed however, so I'm not sure if was a tagged fish. Estimated moralities at the  time of release was 16 fish.  The first two truckloads of fish were loaded into the net pen at 1620 and the last truckload was in the net pen by 1650.  The tide was slightly incoming.  Water temperature was 15.2C, salinity was 0.1 ppt.  Tide became slack at 1714 and turned to outgoing at 1727.  The fish were released while drifting on the outgoing tide at 1755.  The release point was 38.043358/-121.726092.  Acclimation time was approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. The weather was partly cloudy and breezy. One angler boat was observed, but no landings. We landed one small striper but striper presence appeared to be low. There was no bird predation during the release."
